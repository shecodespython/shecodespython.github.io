## Project 2: Harry Potter Universe Social Network Analysis - Bibliometric Analysis Project & Visualization
- **Description:** ðŸ§™ This project is a social network analysis of the Harry Potter book series. The network was created by extracting characters (nodes) and their interactions (edges) from the text of the books using the spacy library. The scope of this project is to identify important characters, communities, and track character importance over time using the networkx library. This project is inspired by Thu Vu data analytics on YouTube.

## Project 3: Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning Methods - Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification Project
- **Description:** ðŸ«€ The provided two Jupyter notebooks (labeled I. and II.) employ several Python-based Machine Learning and Data Science libraries to extract insight from data related to heart disease patients. In this project my aim is to construct a classification model to ascertain whether a patient suffers from heart disease and, if so, to determine the specific type of heart disease based on their medical records (various features).
